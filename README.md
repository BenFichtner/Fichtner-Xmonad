# Fichtner Xmonad Environment
Arch Linux Dotfiles

Here is a collection of configuration files pertaining to Xmonad and Xmobar on Arch Linux.  Although these files have been tested using Debian and Fedora they are only maintained and developed using Arch Linux.  If you are looking at these files though, I'm sure you are aware of the differences between various Linux distributions and how to deal with that.  In any case, the ultimate goal of this project is to use these files to create a unified Xmonad setup that can be deployed on an Arch Linux machine via a customized install script with pre-configured and selectable default settings for an easy install experience.  In the future I would like to do the same with Fedora.

CURRENT GOAL: Integrate the dotfiles from my Laptop and Desktop Arch Linux machines into a single unified dotfile setup.
