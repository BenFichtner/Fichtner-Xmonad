# Fichtner Xmonad Environment
Arch Linux Dotfiles

Here is a collection of configuration files pertaining to Xmonad and Xmobar on Arch Linux.  These files have also been tested on Fedora and Debian, though are only maintained on two Arch Linux systems.  The ultimate goal of this project is to use these files to create a unified Xmonad setup that can be deployed on an Arch Linux machine via a customized install script with pre-configured and selectable default settings for an easy install experience.  

CURRENT GOAL: Integrate the dotfiles from my Laptop and Desktop Arch Linux machines into a single unified dotfile setup.
